Thanks for stopping by! I am an applied researcher working on topics that will hopefully bring value to both ATT and the larger research community, preferably in that order &#128556;. My interests span the following areas:
* Software-defined network control of both the core and RAN
* Application verticals like video, augmented reality, drones etc, that can leverage fine-grained control of the 5G/LTE RAN
* Large-scale distributed systems and storage 

In a prohibitively long &#128564;, but enjoyable Ph.D. at UT Austin under Vijay Garg, I focused on coding-theoretic fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Following this, I worked as a Postdoc at Princeton University with Mung Chiang.

My wife, Mini, writes/edits children's books. When you don't want to just read pulsatingly thrilling and pulpy papers about data fault tolerance, do drop by her <a href="https://missmini.home.blog">blog</a>.
