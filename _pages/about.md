Thanks for stopping by :-) I am an applied researcher working on topics that will hopefully bring value to both ATT and the larger research community, preferably in that order. My interests span the following areas:
* Software-defined network control of both the core and RAN
* Application verticals like Video, AR, drones etc, that can leverage fine-grained control of the LTE/5G RAN
* Large-scale distributed systems and storage 

In a prohibitively long &#128564;, but enjoyable <span style="color:blue">Ph.D. at UT Austin</span> under Vijay Garg, I focused on coding-theoretic fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Following this, I worked as <span style="color:blue">Postdoc at Princeton University</span> in with Mung Chiang.
