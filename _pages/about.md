Thanks for stopping by! I am an applied researcher working on topics that will 
hopefully achieve the trinity of production deployments, top-tier conference papers and open-source contributions. My interests span the following areas (in no particular order):
* Software-defined network control of both the core and RAN
* Application verticals like video, augmented reality, drones etc, that can leverage fine-grained control of the 5G/LTE RAN
* Large-scale distributed systems and storage 

In a prohibitively long &#128564;, but enjoyable Ph.D. (2005-2012) at UT Austin under Vijay Garg, I focused on coding-theoretic fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Following this, I worked as a Postdoc at Princeton University with Mung Chiang (2012-2014). Since then I have been at ATT Labs Research. 

My wife, Mini, writes and edits children's books. If you want a read beyond my pulsatingly thrilling and pulpy papers, do drop by her <a href="https://missmini.home.blog">blog</a>.

# Recent Work
Currently (2018-Present), my focus is on the software-defined control of the RAN. Specifically, I work on the following aspects of a 5G/LTE RAN Intelligent controller (RIC) that was intitated by ATT and Nokia and is now open-sourced through the <a href="https://www.o-ran.org/">O-RAN</a> alliance:
* As product of the RIC, I identify key software deliverables across various teams in ATT and Nokia, coordinate live trials of the software and associated use-cases on our network and lead a team that performs the end-to-end testing and validation of the RIC. 
* As use-case manager for the RIC, work with various business-units to prioritize use-cases of the RIC and perform financial modeling to convert technical gains (e.g. % throughput improvement) into actual dollars saved. 
* Collaborate with universities forward-looking applications of the RIC in diverse areas such as augmented reality <a href="https://bharathgituser.github.io/files/ar_secon_2020.pdf">(Secon 2020)</a>, localization <a href="https://bharathgituser.github.io/files/pinpoint_lanman_2020.pdf">(Lanman 2020)</a>, drones <a drones  href="https://bharathgituser.github.io/files/drone_hotnets_2020.pdf">(HotNets 2020)</a>, and video analytics.
