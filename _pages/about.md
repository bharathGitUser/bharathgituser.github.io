Thanks for stopping by :-) I am an applied researcher working on topics that will hopefully bring value to both ATT and the larger research community. My interests span the following areas:
* Software-defined network control (both core and RAN)
* Application verticals like Video, AR, drones etc, that can leverage fine-grained control of the LTE/5G RAN
* Large-scale distributed systems and storage 

In a prohibitively long, but enjoyable <span style="color:blue">Ph.D. at UT Austin</span> under Vijay Garg, I focused on coding-theoretic fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Following this, I worked as <span style="color:blue">Postdoc at Princeton University</span> in with Mung Chiang.

# Current Work
My current areas of active research are defined by two roles I play within ATT as part of  open-source Linux Foundation Projects. 

ATT-Nokia Co-create/ORAN RIC: Product Owner for the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) under the ATT-Nokia co-create program. The RIC is a near-real-time software controller that controls various aspect of the RAN control plane through AI/ML techniques to enable better cellular network optimization and bring forth new services for verticals such as AR/VR and Drone applications (see demo at the end of the page!).   

ONAP MUSIC: Project Technical Lead for geo-distributed state management aspects of ONAP, an open-source project for software-defined network automation. In this role, along with my team, we built the MUSIC tool for multi-site state management, that is currently managing the state for different ATT components in production. Work broadly associated with this has appeared in PODC, ICDCS, HotEdge, HotCloud and IEEE Cloud.
